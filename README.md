# PlacingCovid19Workshop
This workshop introduces ecological analysis to explore demographic characteristics of places and explain uneven patterns of social phenomena. We model the association between Covid cases, and deprivation, occupation, ethnic diversity, housing conditions and age profile to illustrate the power of ecological analysis. On completion of the workshop, you will appreciate the statistical geography of England, the data available from standard census tables and be able to extract relevant indicators from them, explore their spatial distribution and develop a statistical model for the rate of Covid cases by local area in England. The workshop uses the GeoDa software, a user-friendly interactive tool to analyse spatial data. The skills and knowledge you develop will inform future spatial analyses of social phenomena using data from the 2021 census when this becomes available. We will provide materials for you to explore your own research questions and be available to answer questions during the festival.
